Test Automation for Practice Software Testing Website Using Cypress and POM

Introduction

This project aims to develop an end-to-end automation testing framework for the Practice Software Testing website. It leverages Cypress and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability. The framework validates core functionalities such as login, signup, category navigation, filters, and form submissions, addressing quality assurance needs efficiently.

Features

Login and signup processes with validation for valid/invalid credentials.

Navigation through product categories and application of filters.

Form submissions for the Contact Us page with error handling.

Verification of navigation links, page functionality, and content accuracy.

Design Decisions or Assumptions

Use of Cypress for its robust end-to-end testing capabilities.

Implementation of POM for scalability and ease of maintenance.

Assertions included within page object methods for better test readability.

Assumes a stable and consistent backend API for test execution.

Installation & Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/test-automation.git
cd test-automation
npm install
npx cypress open

Usage

Run the test cases using the Cypress Test Runner:

npx cypress run

Include screenshots as necessary for better understanding.

Credentials

Provide valid credentials for testing authenticated pages:

Username: testuser

Password: password123

APIs Used

N/A (This project does not rely on external APIs.)

API Endpoints

N/A (This is a testing framework, not a backend application.)

Technology Stack

Cypress: For end-to-end testing.

JavaScript: For scripting test cases and defining page objects.

Mocha: For organizing test cases.

Chai: For assertions.

Expected Outcome

A complete test automation framework for the Practice Software Testing website.

Comprehensive and reusable documentation of testing efforts.

Reliable scripts to validate the website’s core functionalities, ensuring consistent quality and usability.
